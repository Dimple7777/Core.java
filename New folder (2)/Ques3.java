// Ques 3 :

// 1)  final keyword: this keyword is used to make the assigned value constant . if the value is tried to change it will create an error.
//     eg. final int a = 7;
//     final keyword cannot be used in front of classes.

// 2)  Packages : group of classes, subclasses and interface or in other words folder of classes.
//     packages are of two types : Built in and user defined
//     Built in are util, net and User defined can be a folder created by user it can be of any name. for example - my_pack etc.

// 3)  Access Specifiers: access specifiers are used to determine the access of the class, methods and functions.
//     access specifiers are :
//         default       (
//         public
//         private
//         protected
